## Implementation Approach

### Minimal Changes Philosophy
All changes were implemented with surgical precision:
- Modified only 1 main file: `src/Scripts/Start-FileManager.ps1`
- Added 4 new test files (no modification to existing tests)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- No changes to module files (PowerToys integration was already complete)

### Code Quality
- All changes maintain existing code style
- Proper error handling in all new features
- Try-finally blocks for cleanup in tests
- Platform-independent implementations

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing features remain functional
- Existing keyboard shortcuts maintained
- No changes to module interfaces
- Tests run alongside existing tests

## Features Not Implemented (Out of Scope)

The following features from the problem statement were intentionally not implemented to maintain minimal changes:

1. **Loading Indicators** - Would require significant changes to asynchronous operations
2. **Open With...** in context menu - Would require external application integration framework

These can be implemented as future enhancements.
